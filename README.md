# SoteriaTesting

Java EE Security (JSR 375)

"Soteria currently fully runs on Payara 4.1.1.161, JBoss WildFly 10 and TomEE 7.0.2-SNAPSHOT from 12-10 (with Tomcat 8.5.6)."
I am using wildfly 10 connected to a PostgreSQL database.

This project was made by following along with Sukma Wardana's (https://github.com/swhp) article on Medium:

	"Playing with Java EE Security (JSR-375) — Soteria"
    (https://medium.com/@swhp/playing-with-java-ee-security-jsr-375-soteria-38e8d2b094d4)

Only minor edits were made to class references to sort out what I figured were some inconsistencies during editing.

It appears that since my first reading of his article he has posted a full implementation:
